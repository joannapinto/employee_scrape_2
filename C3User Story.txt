User Story:
Title: Scraping Employee Data from Google Drive File

As a developer,
I want to scrape employee data from the provided Google Drive file URL (https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AWPf-pJodJKeHsARQK_RHiNsE8fjPCVK&export=download),
so that I can ingest the data into our data warehouse for further analysis.

Acceptance Criteria:
File Download:

The scraper must initiate a successful download of the file from the provided Google Drive URL.
The URL must return a valid file (e.g., CSV, Excel, or other supported formats).
Data Structure Validation:

Once the file is downloaded, the scraper must correctly identify the file type (CSV, Excel, etc.).
The scraper should parse the file into the correct format (e.g., CSV rows, Excel sheet).
The employee data should be mapped to fields like:
Employee ID
First Name
Last Name
Email
Job Title
Phone Number
Hire Date
Error Handling:

If the URL is inaccessible or the file download fails, the scraper should log the error and retry the process a limited number of times before sending a failure notification.
If the file format is invalid or unexpected, the scraper should notify the user with the error message and log the issue.

Test Cases:
Test Case 1: Verify CSV File Download
Test Case 2: Verify CSV File Extraction
Test Case 3: Validate File Type and Format
Test Case 4: Validate Data Structure
Test Case 5: Handle Missing or Invalid Data
