User Story: Data Mapping and Filtering Using Reference Excel Sheet
Title:
As a developer, I want to filter rows from a reference Excel file based on values present in a raw_data file so that I can generate a mapped output dataset.

Description:
You are provided with a list of 100 sample records (raw_data.csv). Each record contains a unique identifier. You are also given a reference Excel file (reference_data.xlsx) that contains a master list with detailed information for a wide range of values.

Your task is to:

Match each value from the raw dataset with a specific column (lookup_key) in the reference Excel.

If a match is found, extract the entire row from the reference Excel file.

Combine all the matched rows into a new output file called mapped_output.csv.

Acceptance Criteria:
The script should only fetch rows that have matching values from the raw dataset.

The output file should contain all columns from the reference Excel sheet.

The number of rows in the output should correspond to the number of matching values.

Ensure no duplicates if the raw data has repeated values.
